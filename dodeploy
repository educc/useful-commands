# directory's name. If the OWN_DOCKER_REGISTRY environment variable is set,
# the image will be tagged with the registry and pushed. Otherwise, only 
# the build step is executed.
#
# Usage: ./build_and_push.sh
#
# Make the script executable:
#   chmod +x build_and_push.sh
#
# Then run it:
#   ./build_and_push.sh
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Get the current folder name (this will be our image name).
